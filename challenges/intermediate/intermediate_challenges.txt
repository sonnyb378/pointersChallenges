Input:
str1 := "Hello"
str2 := "World"

Output:
str1 is now "World"
str2 is now "Hello"

Incorrect Output:
str1 is still "Hello"

Challenge 5: Update Struct Fields with Pointers
Description: Write a function that takes a pointer to a struct and updates one or more of its fields.

Input:
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

person := &Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 25}
updatePerson(person, "Bob", 30)

Output:
Person{Name: "Bob", Age: 30}

Incorrect Output:
Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 25}

Challenge 6: Modify Map Value Using Pointer
Description: Write a Go function that takes a pointer to a map and modifies the value associated with a given key.

Input:
myMap := map[string]int{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
key := "b"
newValue := 10

Output:
myMap is now map[a:1 b:10 c:3]

Incorrect Output:
myMap is still map[a:1 b:2 c:3]
