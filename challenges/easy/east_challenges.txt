Challenge 1: Swap Two Integers
Description: Write a Go function that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

Input:
a := 5
b := 10

Output:
a is now 10
b is now 5

Incorrect Output:
a is still 5
b is still 10

Challenge 2: Modify Slice Element
Description: Write a function that takes a slice and a position as input, and changes the value of the element at that position to a new value.

Input:
slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
position := 2
newValue := 10

Output:
slice is now [1 2 10 4 5]

Incorrect Output:
slice is still [1 2 3 4 5]

Challenge 3: Increment Using Pointer
Description: Write a Go function that takes a pointer to an integer and increments the value it points to.

Input:
num := 5
pointer := &num

Output:
num is now 6

Incorrect Output:
num is still 5
